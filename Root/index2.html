    <div class="text1">
      I've got experience in various different areas from heavy engineering to customer services.
      I have always been interested in technology and computers but have never tried to pursue it as a career until now.
      I have been self teaching myself by working through various html and css courses on code academy so that I could learn all the basics of making a website.
      I have also been very lucky in knowing two very experienced web developers, who have given me plenty of help to get me where I am now in a relatively short period of time.
      Hopefully, after plenty of small projects and practice I will be able to use it as a full time career.

      As well as technology, my main passion is my superb Cannondale Supersix Evo road bike which I try to ride as much as I can. I try to do as many Charity Sportives as posible as well as pleanty of training rides to keep my fitness up.
      I am also a member of the Cyclesense Cycling Club which is run by the local bike shop. I've been cycling properly for over 10 Years and am still finding new, exciting rides,
      and will hopefully carry on finding them for years to come.
